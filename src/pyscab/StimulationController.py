        AudioHardwareController : An instance of pyscab.AudioHardwareController class
        marker_send : reference to a function
            A reference to function for send a marker
        mode : str {'serial', 'pararell'} default = 'serial'
            If it's set to 'pararell', it can be controll from parent process.
        time_tick : float, default=0.0001
            pause between each loop in play() function. In terms of real time, it should be reduced.
            However, it also caused intence compulational load.
        status : int or instance of multiprocessing.Value class
            0 : stopped
            1 : running
            When mode is set to 'serial', type of status is Boolean.
            When mode is set to 'pararell', type of status is an instance of multiprocessing.Value class.
            When it's working in pararell mode, it will be stop playing immediate after status is changed to 0.
            e.g., when you are presenting stimulus in online BCI application with dynamic stopping,
            you need to stop playing when it's triggered. In that case, you need to set mode to pararell and use status variable.
