        Attributes
        ----------
        AudioHardwareController : An instance of pyscab.AudioHardwareController class
        marker_send : reference to a function
            A reference to function for send a marker
        mode : str {'serial', 'pararell'} default = 'serial'
            If it's set to 'pararell', it can be controll from parent process.
        time_tick : float, default=0.0001
            pause between each loop in play() function. In terms of real time, it should be reduced.
            However, it also caused intence compulational load.
        share : list or instance of multiprocessing class
            0 : before playing
            1 : playing
            2 : finish playing

            share[0] is used for sharing runnin status.
            When it's working in pararell mode, it will be stop playing immediate after share is changed to other than 1.
            e.g., when you are presenting stimulus in online BCI application with dynamic stopping,
            you need to stop playing when it's triggered. In that case, you need to set mode to pararell and use share variable.

            share[1] is used for sharing current marker value.
